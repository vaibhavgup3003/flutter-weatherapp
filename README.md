# A Real Time and Location Weather App: Clima4
- Clima is a FLUTTER bases project which implements the use of asynchronous programming with DART use of APIs and fetching data forward and backward using navigators.
- We used the [OpenWeathterMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the weather data.
This project focuses at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.
